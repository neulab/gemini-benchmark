What is the probability that all three toys are cars?\n\nA: There are 6 cars and 12 non-cars (18 - 6 = 12) in the box. The probability of picking a car on the first draw is 6 / 18 = 1 / 3. After drawing one car, there are 5 cars and 12 non-cars left, so the probability of picking a car on the second draw is 5 / 17. After drawing two cars, there are 4 cars and 12 non-cars left, so the probability of picking a car on the third draw is 4 / 16 = 1 / 4. The probability of picking three cars in succession is 1 / 3 x 5 / 17 x 1 / 4 = 5 / 204 = 1 / 40.8.
