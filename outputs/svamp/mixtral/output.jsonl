The bakery sells whole wheat bread for $2 a loaf, white bread for $1.50 a loaf, and rye bread for $2.50 a loaf. If the bakery sells 150 loaves of bread and makes $300, how many loaves of each type of bread were sold?\n\nA: The bakery sells whole wheat bread for $2 a loaf, white bread for $1.50 a loaf, and rye bread for $2.50 a loaf. If the bakery sells 150 loaves of bread and makes $300, then the total cost of the bread sold is 150 * 2 for whole wheat, 150 * 1.5 for white, and 150 * 2.5 for rye. This equals 300, 225, and 375 respectively. The total cost of the bread sold is 300 + 225 + 375 = 900. But the bakery only made $300. So the number of loaves of each type of bread were sold must be multiplied by a factor of 300/900 = 1/3. This gives 150 * 1/3 = 50 for whole wheat, 150 * 1/3 = 50 for white, and 150 * 1/3 = 50 for rye.
