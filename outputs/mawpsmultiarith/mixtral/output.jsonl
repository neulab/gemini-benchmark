The rest are in the band. There are 3 times as many trumpet players in the band as there are violin players in the orchestra. There are 5 more trumpet players than violin players. How many trumpet players are there in the band?\n\nA: There are 100 students. 25 are in the orchestra. So 100 - 25 = 75 are in the band. The number of trumpet players is 3 times the number of violin players. So if there are 5 more trumpet players, then the number of trumpet players is 5 more than 3 times the number of violin players. Let's call the number of violin players x. So the number of trumpet players is 3x + 5. The total number of band members is 75. So the number of trumpet players plus the number of violin players is 75. That means 3x + 5 + x = 75. Combining the x terms gives 4x + 5 = 75. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives 4x = 70. Dividing both sides by 4 gives x = 17.5. But the number of violin players can't be a fraction, so x must be 17. So the number of trumpet players is 3x + 5 = 3*17 + 5 = 56.
